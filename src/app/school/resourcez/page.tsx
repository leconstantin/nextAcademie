          <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
          <p>
            For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic
            bread with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an
            iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm,
            cheesy loaf for Halloween.

            But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked
            to a series of rabies cases springing up around the country.

              At [School Name], we are committed to ensuring the health, safety,
              and well-being of all students, staff, and visitors. Below, you

                  All students are required to meet state and district
                  immunization standards to ensure a healthy school environment.
                  Parents must submit proof of their childâ€™s immunizations
                  before enrollment. Review the full list of required
                  vaccinations and deadlines in the document above.

                  Students who need to take prescription or over-the-counter
                  medications during school hours must have prior approval. A
                  signed medication administration form must be submitted by the
                  parent or guardian. The school nurse will oversee the
                  administration of medication to ensure safety and compliance.

                  Parents are required to provide up-to-date emergency health
                  information for each student, including allergies, chronic
                  conditions, and emergency contacts. This information helps
                  ensure that the school is prepared in case of a health
                  emergency.

                  We take food allergies very seriously. The school implements
                  strict policies to protect students with allergies, including
                  clearly labeled foods in the cafeteria and strict protocols
                  for avoiding cross-contamination. Parents of children with
                  allergies must submit a medical action plan that outlines
                  emergency procedures.
